This project is a machine learning project that aims to perform sentiment analysis using news texts and classify texts into specific categories. The project includes cleaning text data, vectorization, training classification models, and evaluation stages.


## Key Features:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Cleaning text data, converting to lowercase, cleaning special characters and removing stop words.

- **Vectorization:** Converting text data to vectors using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) method.

- **Classification Models:**

1- Decision Tree

2- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

3- Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)

4- Naive Bayes

5- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

6- Random Forest

7- Logistic Regression

8- Gradient Boosting

- **Model Optimization:** Hyperparameter optimization with Grid Search.

- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluation of model performance with classification report, accuracy score and cross-validation.

- **Model Saving and Loading:** Saving trained models and loading them for reuse.
